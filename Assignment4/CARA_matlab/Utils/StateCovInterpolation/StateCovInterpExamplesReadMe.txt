The "StateCovInterpExamples.m" function shows two
examples of how to use the "StateCovInterp.m" function
for position/velocity state vector and covariance matrix
interpolation, along with comparisons to the
"LagrangeInterp.m" function, which it is designed to replace.

Running the "StateCovInterpExamples.m" function requires
that the SDK libarary be on the Matlab path (see lines
26-28 of the file).

Note that "StateCovInterp.m" expects input position,
velocity, and covariance arrays in km and km/s units.
